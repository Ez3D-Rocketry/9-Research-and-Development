# So many options, so little time

As I started on a simple 3D fin can that a group of young students could assemble and fly quickly, the idea of scaling up the design quicky followed. 

13mm to 18mm to 24mm motors. BT-20 to BT-50 and beyond. Combinations and Permutations. Where does it end? 

I framed the design space with a matrix that mapped out the possibilities and assigned them 'working names' associated with the motor size in millimeters and body tube per the Estes designation. 

For example, the Ez3D-1855 supports an 18mm motor with a fin can that transitions to a BT-55 airframe. 

But how long of an airframe? My original design used a 6-inch portion since I could cut the commercial 18-inch length into three 6-inch segments. Models with larger motors required a longer airframe so a 9-inch (i.e. cut the 18 inch tube in half) and 18-inch lengths came naturally. 
The dashed number at the end of the Ez number indicates the length. 

I decided all models would have four fins of 2mm thick. This helps with printing surface plate adhesion (although using a brim and plenty of glue stick really helps too). 

I then choose which models from the matrix would graduate from an 'engineering designation' to a 'marketing name'. They follow a natural progression of increasing motor case sizes and body tube diameters but in reality, any of the mixing and matching would work just fine. If you want to modify one of the FreeCAD drawings and make your own variation - please do! That is why all the files and this methodology are here. 

In reality, the matrix could keep going: Q-jet, Enerjet, Micro-MAXX, CTI, DMS, RMS. But the goal was to set you up with the tools for your own success. My path is not your path. I wish you the best. 

Enough talk. Here's the big matrix.
